# polyphemus_methane
Methane plume modelling in Polyphemus. My work with ECCC over summer 2021.

## Further Goals

1. Test whether Polyphemus pre-processing and processing may be done elsewhere, and thus outputs may be generated elsewhere. Would be nice to stored them outside `src/libs/`.

1. Thorough testing to ensure refactoring preserved functionality.

1. More informative central documentation, e.g. populating this README.

1. Migration to CentOS 7.

## Stretch Goals

1. Vectorization.
